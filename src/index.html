      <p class="blogs">With a name like Plump Pig Smokehouse, you canâ€™t be interested
        in this website. Harry is are based out of Gunn ,AB, and a
        part of the Alberta BBQ Association as well as the Edmonton City Barbeque Society.

        and his lovely co-worker Janice have some really awesome BBQ
        competition stories, great video recaps and
        enough recipes to keep you occupied for years to come.

        Harry has created a program for at-risk youths. This Grilling Life Skillings
        program is a fantastic idea and we
        are proud to have Harry as our number 1 pick!<br>

        <br><span class="name"> Favorite Recipe:</span> Surf n Turf Tri Trip Wrapped Scallops.
        These things are as delicious as they are good-looking.
        These little guys are going to impress even the hardest of guests.
